\begin{problem}
        \begin{statement}
                Alice and Bob play a game over the natural numbers. Starting with 2, they alternate increasing this number by a quantity between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). If at the end of a turn, the number is composite, then the game ends, and the player who made the last move looses. Who has a winning strategy?
        \end{statement}
	\begin{hint}
	        If Alice does not have a winning strategy, how would Bob start the game?
	\end{hint}
	\begin{solution}
